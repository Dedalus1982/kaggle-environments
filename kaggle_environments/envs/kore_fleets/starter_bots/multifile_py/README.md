# Multiline Python

You can now submit multiple files together in one submission!

The only trick is that they all need to be tar.gz together, with `main.py` as your main file in the top level of the tar.

# Running locally

*  `run.sh` will run your bot against 3 copies of itself
*  `solo_run.sh` will run your bot in the 1-player environment
*  Both will create an `out.log` log file and a `replay.html` which can be opened in your browser to view the replay locally

# Submitting

Run `package.sh` or tar.gz everything together and upload it to kaggle!
